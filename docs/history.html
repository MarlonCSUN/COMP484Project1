            The history of the Toyota 86/Subaru BRZ/Scion FR-S 
            is a long and storied one, with the car being developed
            as a joint effort between Toyota and Subaru. The car was
            first introduced in 2012 and has since become a beloved sports
            car among enthusiasts. I have been a fan of the chasis since 2016.
            My Aunt owned one which led to my brother owning one and that same car
            my brother owned becoming my first car. I have owned the car for 
            several year and have made many modifications to it, which is documented
            in the modifications section of this website.

        <h3>The Timeline</h3>
        <!-- I used the translate attribute to prevent translation of this section -->
        <p translate="no">
            2018: The car officially becomes mine after my brother 
            and I start thinking about what I want to do with the car
            <br>
            2019: I've already started making modifications to the car
            and have made a list of modifications I want to do to the car.
            <br>
            2020: COVID-19 hits and I am not able to work on the car as much
            as I would like to. It was a very slow year for the car.
            <br>
            2021: I start working on the car again and make some progress on the
            suspension and engine modifications. 
            <br>
            2022: I snag a crazy deal on a JDL Turbo Kit and decide to go for it.
            I now start preparing the car for the kit.
            <br>
            2023: After a long wait, the turbo kit is officially installed with all 
            necessary supporting modifications. 
            <br>
            2024: Unfortunately, the car suffers a catastrophic engine failure and 
            I have to rebuild the engine.
            <br>
            2025: The engine is rebuilt and the tuning process is finished, the car is 
            back on the road and running better than ever. <br> However I am forced to get 
            another car for daily use due to the extensive list of modifications on the car.
