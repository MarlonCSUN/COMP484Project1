            <!-- I used the translate attribute to prevent translation of this section -->
            <p class="intro" translate="no">I share my passion for cars and automotive knowledge through this blog.
            <br>
            I am particularly sharing my journey with my 2013 Toyota 86, 
            which I have owned for several years and have made many modifications to.
            I am also sharing some of the general history of the car as well as the 
            my personal history with the car in the History Section of this website.
            I am also sharing some information regarding the Southern California
            86 community in the Community Section of this website. In my last section
            I am sharing the modifications I have made to the car as well as some of my
            future plans for the car. This website is a project for my COMP 484 
            class and is meant to be a fun way for me to share my passion for cars.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <!-- I used the translate attribute to prevent translation of this section -->
            <p class="intro" translate="no">My name is Marlon Rios and I am a student at California State
            University. I am currently majoring in Computer Science and 
            I have a passion for all things tech as well all things automotive.
            I currently work in the Information Technology field but I have always
            been interested in creating websites. I love web development and being 
            able to combine both my interests into 1 for this assignment was a lot 
            of fun for me. Since I have been interested in cars for as long as I can remember and 
            I have been working on cars for several years now I thought what better
            than to create a website that shares my experience with my car. Although 
            I don't think this website will ever leave my github repository, this was 
            a fun project for me to work on.
