            <h3>My Future Plans</h3>
            <p>My future plans for the car include an extensive list of modifications
                rangning from engine work to supsension to cosmetic exterior upgrades.
                I plan to continue to document my build process and share my experiences with the 86 community.
                I hope to be able to connect with other 86 enthusiasts and share knowledge as well as
                learn from others in the community. I am excited to see where this build takes me and
                look forward to sharing my journey with others. At the current moment the car
                is extremely fun as shown on this 
                <!-- I used the optimum attribute to showcase that the optimal value of this fun meter is of course
                 100, however it is currently not at 100 -->
                <meter min="0" max="100" optimum="100" value="80" class="funMeter"> Fun Meter </meter>
                The only reason it isn't higher is because it has been extremely expensive to repair
                recently and it is still having some issues, but when the car is running as it should
                it is an absolute blast to drive.
